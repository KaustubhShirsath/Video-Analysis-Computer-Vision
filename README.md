Our challenge here is to calculate the screen time of both Tom and Jerry from a given video. Let me first summarize the steps we will follow in this article to crack this problem:

1. Import and read the video, extract frames from it, and save them as images
2. Label a few images for training the model (Donâ€™t worry, I have done it for you)
3. Build our model on training data
4. Make predictions for the remaining images
5. Calculate the screen time of both TOM and JERRY
